              -----------------------------
              Version 0.7 of the cs-techrep class
                  Christoph P. Neumann
              -----------------------------

This LaTeX class provides a simple environment for
technical reports in computer science and software engineering.

As this class is created mainly for ourselves it does not
contain evil low-level TeX magic but instead uses many other
fancy LaTeX packages that we hope you have already installed.

This work may be distributed and/or modified under the
conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3c
of this license or (at your option) any later version.

and version 1.3c or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX
version 2008/05/04 or later.


Installation
------------

This will be extract some files (cs-techrep.cls, cs-techrepNLS.sty...). Create a
directory beneath your TeX installation preferably create 

  tex/latex/cs-techrep

and copy all files of the package and the extracted files to that directory.

Call:

  mktexlsr
